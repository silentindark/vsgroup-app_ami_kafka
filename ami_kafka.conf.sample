;
; AMI Events Kafka Publisher Configuration
;
; This module captures all AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface) events via
; an internal hook and publishes them to a Kafka topic via res_kafka.
;

[general]
; Enable or disable the module (yes/no)
enabled = yes

; Output format: json or ami (default: json)
;   json - parses AMI key/value pairs into a JSON object
;   ami  - publishes the raw AMI text as-is
format = json

; Event filters (same syntax as Asterisk manager.conf eventfilter)
;
; Without any filters, all AMI events are published.
;
; Logic:
;   - Include filters only: only matching events are published
;   - Exclude filters only: all events except matching ones are published
;   - Both: include filters are evaluated first, then exclude filters
;
; Legacy syntax (regex applied to the full AMI body):
;eventfilter = Event: Newchannel
;eventfilter = !Channel: Local/
;
; Advanced syntax (more efficient, avoids regex):
;eventfilter(action(include),name(Newchannel)) =
;eventfilter(action(include),name(Hangup)) =
;eventfilter(action(exclude),header(Channel),method(starts_with)) = Local/
;
; Available methods: regex, exact, starts_with, ends_with, contains, none
; When only name() is specified with no value, method defaults to "none"
; (matches any event with that name regardless of content).

[kafka]
; Name of the connection defined in kafka.conf (res_kafka)
connection = my-kafka

; Kafka topic to publish AMI events to
topic = asterisk_ami
